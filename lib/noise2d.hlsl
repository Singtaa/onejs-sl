// Scrolling fBm value noise, shared by OneJS/TextureFX and OneJS/FxSources.
//
// Computed from a seed rather than sampled, so an effect needs no texture, any
// seed works without shipping art for it, and the field is infinite: scrolling
// never repeats and never has to tile.
//
// This lives in its own include because two shaders want it. Keeping a second
// copy in each would let them drift, and a noise field that differs by shader
// is the kind of thing nobody notices until two effects that should match do
// not.

// MARK: hash
//
// The lattice hash is integer arithmetic, and has to stay integer arithmetic.
// A float hash, frac of a large product as most shader noise is written, is
// only as exact as the compiler lets it be: one that contracts a multiply and
// an add into a single rounding computes a different hash, and a different
// hash is a different picture. Dawn on Windows contracted frac(p * k + c), and
// Metal computes dot(p, q) as fma(p.y, q.y, p.x * q.x), so one program drew a
// different noise on each. 32 bit unsigned multiply, add, xor and shift wrap
// modulo 2^32 on every target (HLSL, Metal, GLSL ES 3.00 highp and WGSL), so
// nothing is left for a compiler to round. goldens/probes.hlsl holds both
// hashes to the bit, and src/lib/lib.test.ts refuses a frac in any of them.
